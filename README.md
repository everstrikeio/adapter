## Requirements

- Docker `v20.10.8`
- 0.01 Amoy MATIC

## Local Setup

1. Specify your private key in hardhat.config.local.js and in client/node.js

```javascript
const PRIVATE_KEY = "<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>";
```

The default network is Polygon Amoy. You will need Amoy MATIC to run this adapter. Get Amoy MATIC here: [https://faucet.polygon.technology/](https://faucet.polygon.technology/)

2. Make sure you have Docker installed

```bash
docker version;
```

3. Build and run Docker image

```bash
bash build.sh;
```

4. Verify that container is running

```bash
docker logs adapter;
# Should see an output of wallet addresses and private keys
```

5. Compile contract

```bash
bash compile.sh;
```

6. Deploy contract

```bash
bash deploy.sh
```

7. Run our client (`client/node.js`) against the deployed contract

```bash
bash run.sh # this runs our client/node.js file
```

Voil√†!

Don't forget to delete your container when you're done.

```bash
docker rm -f adapter;
```

## Copy local files to Docker container

Sync your Docker container with your local files

```bash
bash cp.sh
```

## Verify deployed contract

Change the 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 address in the package.json verify:local task to the address of your newly deployed contract, and run the following:

```bash
bash verify.sh
```

For this to work, you will need to specify your Etherscan/Oklink API key in hardhat.config.local.js.

## Deploy Everstrike USDT

Deploy a new instance of Everstrike USDT, and grant yourself all of the supply

```bash
bash deploy_token.sh
```

## Deploy utility libraries

Deploy utility libraries (required for version 1.0.1 and up)

```bash
bash deploy_libraries.sh
```
